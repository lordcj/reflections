When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i know i am a good enough programmer to share my views with all the big people on the web.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
.. There might be a change that must not be a logical change and it would take time to complete it .
......so it would not be gentle of github to automatically push and pull ....... and as a prog-
-rammer i want to have full control over my file .....so it would be nicer if i do it on my own.
